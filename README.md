## Overview
Get ready to take a look at a full-featured code base! You have just started a new job and the employer wants you to demonstrate your skills by building a portfolio using React. This should highlight your knowledge of the React library and your ability to explore a new codebase. The starter code for today contains a React + Bootstrap site with a number of example pages, complete with icons, styles, and themed layouts. Your job is to customize this code by following the specifications in the Trello board.
